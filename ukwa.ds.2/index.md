title: JISC UK Web Domain Dataset (1996-2010)
doi: 10.5259/ukwa.ds.2/1
---

In partnership with [archive.org](http://www.archive.org/) and JISC, we have obtained access to the subset of the Internet Archive's web collection that relates to the UK. The JISC UK Web Domain Dataset (1996-2010) contains all of the resources from the Internet Archive that were hosted on domains ending in '.uk', or that are required in order to render those UK pages.

It is composed of 470466 files, mostly arc.gz, with 4494 warc.gz. Total size: 32TB, Average 71 MB per archive file, but this is very variable because the crawler does not split resources across archives.

This dataset cannot be made generally available, but can be used to generate secondary datasets, and these can be made available under open license terms.
