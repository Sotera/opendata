In order to facilitate research, and so we might better understand and preserve the UK's web history, we make a number of data and API services available for general use.

Datasets & APIs
---------------

We hold the following datasets, from which we offer a number of secondary datasets and, where practical, API access.

* [UK Web Domain Dataset (1996-2010)](ukweb1996to2010)
* [UK Selective Web Archive](ukselective)

### APIs ###

We support a number of different APIs:

* Wayback
* Memento
* Hosted Linked Open Data

However, not all data sets are exposed over the same APIs. Check the dataset descriptions for details.
